# Hi, I'm Daniel!
**(he/him)**

Thanks for stopping by! I'm a native Houstonian and aspiring boba connoiseur currently living in Seattle.

In the past, I've worked a full-stack developer at [SnapStream Media](https://www.snapstream.com/) and a computational research assistant at [T-SCAN](http://tscan.rice.edu/). These days, I'm a backend developer at [ExtraHop Networks](https://www.extrahop.com), maintaining databases and making sure your networks stay secure.

I graduated from Rice University with a B.A. in Computer Science and Cognitive Sciences. My work at T-SCAN leveraged BERT-based language models to predict degrees of linguistic distancing in language, and was published in [Affective Science](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s42761-021-00053-x) in September 2021.
