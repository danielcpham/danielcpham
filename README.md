# Hi, I'm Daniel!
**(he/him)**

Thanks for stopping by! I'm a native Houstonian, recent Blackpink stan, and aspiring boba connoiseur, currently working at Extrahop Networks as a software developer on the middleware team. In the past, I've worked a full-stack developer at SnapStream Media and a computational research assistant at [T-SCAN](http://tscan.rice.edu/). 

I graduated from Rice University with a B.A. in Computer Science and Cognitive Sciences. My work at T-SCAN leveraged BERT-based language models to predict degrees of linguistic distancing in language, and was presented at the [2021 Society of Affective Science Annual Conference](https://society-for-affective-science.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/SAS_2021_Full_Program_I.pdf).
